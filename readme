Tool to automatically generate TerrainDefs (and other things).
Basically a glorified find/replace/copy tool.

The first input file, materials.txt consists of columns and lines.
For each line of this file, a copy of each TerrainDef will be made.
For each column, the relevant Token (which is in line 1 of the column) will be replaced by the entry in the line.
For example, '[NOUN]' might be replaced by 'Sandstone' for one Def, and by 'Granite' for the next Def

The second input file, floors.txt consists of TerrainDef templates.
As aforementioned, these will be copied per line, and the tokens will be replaced.
Each TerrainDef template gets its own file.

Take a look at the included xml files to get an idea of what it does.
